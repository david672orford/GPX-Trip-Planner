The symbols in this directory corespond to some of the symbols available on
Garmin GPS receivers. A list may be found at:

They are designed to represent the same concepts and objects without
necessarily representing them in the same way. For example, the symbol for a
truck stop on an Etrex Legend HCx is a truck seen from the front. Here it
is a trucks seen from the side.

Where the symbol lends itself to 'abuse' (such as the symbols for for cities
and towns which are dots), the general form is preserved.
