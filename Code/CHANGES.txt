==============================================================================
 Changes in version 0.91
==============================================================================

* Added page size Tabloid (17x11)

* Added Garmin-compatible GPX symbols "Circle, Red", "Circle, Green",
  "Circle, Blue"


==============================================================================
 Changes in version 0.90
==============================================================================

* Replaced map widget (which was based on Osmgpsmap) with a new pure-Python
  implementation called PyKarta. This brings the following features:
  * Fractional zoom
  * More than one tile layer at a time (such as for overlays)

* Added support for separately selected overlay layers which were made 
  possible by switching to PyKarta.

* Waypoints now have labels at high zoom.

* Added live GPS support (including track recording)

* Added zoom in and out controls

* Moved map layer selection to a dropdown menu on the top toolbar

* Printing of the default tiles from Openstreetmap.org now downloads and
  uses the SVG version of the map.

* Can now load GPX 1.0 files (though they will be saved in GPX 1.1 format).

* Added POI layer. This layer loads POIs from CSV files.

* Added Photo layer. This layer loads JPEG files with latitude and longitude
  in their EXIF data.

* If a string pasted into the program looks like a coordinate pair and it
  can be parsed, a new waypoint will now be created. (Previously it would
  be pasted into the search tab.)

* On can now delete a route point by clicking on it (with no motion). This
  makes operation more consistent with that of the Leaflet (leafletjs.com)
  and Pykarta's MapVectorLayer.

== Post-Release Bug Fixes ==

* Dropt Cloudmade layers since Cloudmade is dropping its low-usage customers.

* Added missing importation of the re package in module which interprets
  coordinate strings pasted into the program.

* Will now load GPX files with a <copyright> element with no "author" attribute
  even though such files do not conform to GPX 1.1.

==============================================================================
 Changes in version 0.81
==============================================================================

* Fixed problems in the XML description of the GUI which prevented one from
  typing one's own values into the combo boxes for the name of the route to
  which to add a point.

* Added splitting of track segments.

* Double clicking on a waypoint in the treeview still centers it in the map
  and zooms in to level 14 (if the map is not already zoomed in furthur.
  However, single clicking now brings the point into view zooming _out_ if
  necessary and recentering the map so that the clicked-on point is visible
  while keeping everything which was already visible visible.

* Same as above but for search results.

==============================================================================
 Changes in version 0.8 (7 July 2012)
==============================================================================

* Fixed support for <author>, <link>, an <email> tags. (It had been
  incorrectly assumed that these tags had text content.)

* Removed support for saving back to GPSr (since most devices don't support
  this). This inclues renaming "File->Open GPSr" to "File->Import from GPSr".

* Added support for importing from Garmin mass storage devices and sending
  objects to them.

* Added symbols: "Gas Station", "Picnic Area", "Fishing Area"

* The zoom level is now displayed at the bottom right of the status bar.

* Added Stamen Toner OSM map layer

==============================================================================
 Changes in version 0.7
==============================================================================

New Features

* The map can now be printed by choosing File->Print. Crop marks can be turned
on so that one can see in advance where the boundaries of the printed page
are. Turn them on in the View menu.

* The GPSr can be selected. There is basic support for Tomtom, Garmin USB
protocol, and Delorme.

* Search results which are point objects (such as houses and town centers) are
indicated by a magnifying glass symbol that gets bigger as one zooms in. Search
results which are polygons (such as town borders) are indicated by drawing the
border.

* Each waypoint, route, and track can be hidden by clicking on the checkbox
in the left-hand column of the list view, under the eye. All checkboxes in
a column can be set by clicking on the eye in the column header. The display 
state of each object is saved in the GPX file.

* Data from additional GPX files or from LOC files may be imported using
File->Import.

* If the program is invoked with the --import parameter and the name of one
or more files, a new window will not be created. Instead the existing instance
last started will be asked to import the files.

* The script gpx-track-preprocessor.py will take a large number of GPX files
containing tracks as input and output one file per track. The output files
will be Gzip-compressed and will have their bounding boxes in their file names
in order to facilitate rapid searching. If the output directory is stored at
the same level as gpx-trip-planner.exe, then tracks which intersect the current
view can be loaded by choosing File->Import Preprocessed Tracks from the menu.

* The symbol for phantom points (which appear when editing routes and can be
dragged to add new points) has been changed from a smaller circle to a plus.

* The selected waypoint is now indicated by a red X under the symbol rather 
than by circling the symbol.

* There is now a button to clear the search terms and results.

* Map symbols added: Restroom, Residence, Geocache

* The map symbols for points are now also displayed in the list view next to
each item.

* When one zooms using the mouse wheel (currently the only way to zoom), the
point under the mouse pointer now stays under the mouse pointer.

* New map layers: OSM Default, OSM Bike Map, B&W Map

* There is now a command in the Tools menu to merge guide points into the
nearest maneuver point. This feature is still imperfect: if it is used more
than once after the a route is fleshed out, it will continue to remove points.

* When a route is fleshed out, the maneuver points which are added are now
named for the streets or are called "Maneuver" when there is no street name.

* Option Cut added to the Edit menu.

* The drawing color of a route or a track can now be set by selecting the head 
item in the list in the sidebar. A select box will appear in the form below.

Bugs Fixed

* The selector for picking a route which to add a point now allows one to type
a new name into it.

* Coping and pasting with other programs under Win32 may be fixed.

* <ele> and <time> are now cleared when a point is dragged (since neighter one
of then will be true after the location is changed).
