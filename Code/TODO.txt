== Possible Map Layers ==

* Lots of new layers at:
  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers

== Bugs ==

* Visibility of tracks is not always saved properly

* Wrapping around from 180 degress to -180 degrees is not handled properly.
  POIs on only one side the line are shown and that side flips as one scrolls
  the map center back and forth accross this meridian.

== Not Yet Implemented ==

* POIs
 * Show pixbufs in selector
 * Add a way to call loader by passing an option to gpx-trip-planner command.
 * Do something useful when a POI is clicked

* Map improvements
 * Apply pan-zoom rules for waypoints and search results to 
   clicks on route points too.
 * Save layers, center, and zoom level in GPX file.
 * Fix layer ordering so that when a new reference overlay layer is
   enabled it is placed between the top reference overlayer layer
   and the GPX layers in the stacking order. Currently they go to
   the bottom.

* Possible Additional Search Sources
 * Google Maps
 * Geocaching.com
 * Opencaching.us, etc.
 * Geonames.org

* Geocoded image display
 * Support display of images linked to in waypoints

* Improve GPX format support:
 * namespace support is a hack
 * Garmin waypoint address extensions
 * Geocaching extensions

* UI improvements:
 * Hide mode buttons which are not supported
 * Implement Undo

* Garmin support
 * Import from a turned-off GPS produces an GPX parse error. We should
   to try get an error message which specificly names the cause
 * Import of tracks (over the Garmin USB protocol) produces one multi-segment
   track whereas the GPX files which the GPSr writes itself to the SD card
   has multiple tracks. It would be more useful to have multiple tracks
   in both cases.
