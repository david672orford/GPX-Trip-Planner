* Implement Undo

* Map improvements
 * Apply pan-zoom rules for waypoints and search results to 
   clicks on route points too.

* Possible Additional Search Sources
 * Google Maps
 * Geocaching.com
 * Opencaching.us, etc.
 * Geonames.org

* Geocoded image display
 * Support display of images linked to in waypoints

* Improve GPX format support:
 * namespace support is a hack
 * Garmin waypoint address extensions
 * Geocaching extensions

* UI improvements:
 * Hide mode buttons which are not supported

* Garmin support
 * Import from a turned-off GPS produces an GPX parse error. We should
   to try get an error message which specificly names the cause
 * Import of tracks (over the Garmin USB protocol) produces one multi-segment
   track whereas the GPX files which the GPSr writes itself to the SD card
   has multiple tracks. It would be more useful to have multiple tracks
   in both cases.
