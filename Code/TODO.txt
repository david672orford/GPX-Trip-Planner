* Bugs
 * Visibility of tracks is not always saved properly
 * Wrapping around from 180 degress to -180 degrees is not handled properly.
   POIs on only one side the line are shown and that side flips as one scrolls
   the map center back and forth accross this meridian.
  * Import from a turned-off GPS produces an GPX parse error. We should
    to try get an error message which specificly names the cause
  * Import of tracks (over the Garmin USB protocol) produces one multi-segment
    track whereas the GPX files which the GPSr writes itself to the SD card
    has multiple tracks. It would be more useful to have multiple tracks
    in both cases.

* Implement Undo (long term goal)

* Map improvements
 * Apply pan-zoom rules for waypoints and search results to 
   clicks on route points too.
 * Save layers, center, and zoom level in GPX file.
 * Change the waypoint, and route layer to use the same drawing
   semantics as pykarta.map.layers.vector (which follows the 
   example of Leaflet).

* Improve GPX format support:
 * namespace support is a hack
 * Garmin waypoint address extensions
 * Geocaching extensions
 * Display images linked to in waypoints, perhaps in the geocoded
   images tab
* Possible Map Layers
 * Wikipedia POIs: https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GeoData
 * Geocaching.com
 * Opencaching.us, etc.

* Possible Search Sources 
 * Google Maps
 * Geonames.org

* POIs Layer
 * Show pixbufs in selector
 * Add a way to call POI loader (which loads them into the Sqlite database)
   by passing an option to gpx-trip-planner command. Or maybe have it 
   import CSV files using a dependancy system.
 * Should the BMP files be imported into the Sqlite database as blobs?
 * Do something useful (such as displaying a popup) when a POI is clicked.
